The LoadTestSteps class is a part of a Cucumber BDD (Behavior Driven Development) test suite. It uses RestAssured for making HTTP requests and Cucumber annotations for defining the test steps.

Steps for running Cucumber + RestAssured:
Set Up Your Project:

Make sure you have a Java-based project with dependencies like RestAssured, Cucumber, and JUnit.
If you're using Maven, your pom.xml should include dependencies like:
xml
Copy code
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
        <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
        <version>4.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
        <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
        <version>7.11.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
        <version>5.7.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
Also, ensure that you have the Cucumber feature files (.feature) in the correct directory, typically under src/test/resources.
Feature Files:

Your .feature file (written in Gherkin syntax) should define the behavior for registration and login.
Example login.feature file:
gherkin
Copy code
Feature: User Login

Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user provides login details with userName "user123", email "user123@gmail.com", and password "Password@123"
    When the user logs in via the "/client_login" endpoint
    Then the login response should have status code 200
Running the Tests:

To run the tests, use the Cucumber runner with JUnit.
You can create a TestRunner class:
java
Copy code
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    features = "src/test/resources", // path to .feature files
    glue = "com.yourproject.stepdefinitions" // package where step definitions are
)
public class TestRunner {
}
Execute the Tests:

If using Maven, you can run the tests from the command line:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
This will run your tests and produce the results in the console or in a report, depending on how you’ve configured the Cucumber reports.

2. Running the Locust Load Testing Code
The StressTestUser class is a Locust user class that simulates different scenarios of user login. It’s used for stress testing, simulating multiple requests to assess how the server performs under load.

Steps for running Locust tests:
Install Locust:

Install Locust if you haven’t already by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install locust
Save Your Locust Code:

Save your Python code in a file, e.g., load_test.py.
Start Locust:

Run Locust with the command below, which starts the Locust web interface:
bash
Copy code
locust -f load_test.py
This will start a web interface on http://localhost:8089 by default.
Configure and Start the Test:

Once Locust starts, you can open the web interface in your browser.
Set the number of users (simulated users) and the spawn rate (how quickly the users should be spawned).
Click "Start" to begin the load test.
Locust will simulate the login attempts defined in the tasks of your StressTestUser class.
Monitoring the Results:

You can monitor the requests per second (RPS), the response times, and the number of failed requests directly in the Locust web interface.
If needed, you can adjust the number of users to simulate higher traffic and stress the system.
